# -buildvcs=false is what makes the build REPRODUCIBLE, and without it the
# binaries could not be checked against the source at all. Go stamps the commit,
# its timestamp and a vcs.modified flag into every binary - and bin/ is itself
# tracked, so writing the first build dirties the tree the second one reads:
#
#   clean tree  -> build -> vcs.modified=false baked in
#   bin/ written -> tree is now dirty
#   next build  -> vcs.modified=true -> a different binary, same source
#
# So two builds of identical source never matched, and the CI job that recompiles
# and compares would have failed for ever while reporting "bin/ is stale". None
# of that stamp is wanted here anyway: the version comes in through -X.
